The wind blew hot and mean across the cracked earth of a sunbaked speck of a town crouched between two bluffs like a secret kept too long. The sky was a flat sheet of iron, and the only thing louder than the cicadas was the silence between stares. Two days duels under the gaze of every trembling soul in town. Folks had started keeping to the shade, whispering guesses, swapping tall tales about what brought lawmen and legends to the brink. And in that slow, dusty heat, where time seemed to slouch and sweat, the preacher's boy asked the only question worth asking in a place like this: "Y'all ever hear the secret to sanity out here?"

## Solution
