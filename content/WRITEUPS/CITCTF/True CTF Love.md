I got this strange email from another CTF participant not too long ago. I am just not sure what they mean by this...

Do you love CTFs as much as they do?

Then attached is a The_Flag_Well_Capture_Together.eml file.

## Solution

After opening the eml file as a txt file you get:

My dearest one, whose heart I hold,
In your eyes, I see a world untold.
Where logic and riddles dance like stars,
But you, my love, stand behind bars.

I know you don‚Äôt share in my joy,
The flags I chase, the games I deploy.
You sigh, you frown, and often retreat,
While I dive into challenges, so sweet.

But, oh, my love, can you see?
These puzzles are not just code to me.
They‚Äôre like whispers from a distant shore,
A challenge to unlock, a path to explore.

I dream of the day when you‚Äôll join the chase,
And feel the thrill of solving with grace.
Not because you have to, but because you‚Äôll find,
The joy in puzzles that ignites your mind.

I won‚Äôt push, I won‚Äôt rush,
No, I‚Äôll be gentle, soft as a hush.
But if you ever wish to see what I see,
I‚Äôll be here, waiting, with a flag for you and me.

Together, we can solve what‚Äôs unknown,
In the world of CTFs, you won‚Äôt be alone.
Let‚Äôs take it slow, no need to fear,
For love is the answer, my darling, my dear.

So, when you're ready, just take my hand,
Let‚Äôs solve the puzzle, make our stand.
And who knows, perhaps you‚Äôll see‚Äî
That even CTFs, too, can be love‚Äôs key.

A lot of this is garbage and can completely be ignored, but there are some interesting lines, specifically in the DKIM header.

Usually in a DKIM header, there's only one signature (The 'b=') but take a look at the eml file and we have two signatures which is suspicious.

Looking at the signatures they both look like base64.
The first one when decoded gives:
```{¬Æn√Ö7√ö√è)√ó¬π√á¬±¬®1`√°3n√™1F¬∂¬æ‚Ñ¢‚Äö¬´¬èG√π¬∞.S‚ÄîY`T√ê¬¢‚Äú√î√ÅÀÜ‚Ä∞√ª√Ö8LHm&√ó¬±%%≈æCrÔøΩ*¬°:	¬ê'K¬£√®Àú√±√†j58√¶a{v~√≠R++-¬©√¨√õ≈í‚Äú¬∏_√ï√º¬§√Æ¬§‚Äô‚Äù>#√û¬±√É√©√™`I!`N

which is complete gibberish, but by decrypting:
`V293LCB3aGF0IGEgYmVhdXRpZnVsIGxpdHRsZSBwb2VtLiBJIGFsbW9zdCBzaGVkIGEgdGVhciByZWFkaW5nIHRoYXQuIEhvcGVmdWxseSB5b3UgbGVhcm5lZCBtb3JlIGFib3V0IGVtYWlsIGhlYWRlcnMuIEJ1dCBzZXJpb3VzbHksIGl0IGdldHMgbWUgd29uZGVyaW5nLi4uIGRvIHlvdSBsb3ZlIENURnMgYXMgbXVjaCBhcyB0aGV5IGRvPwoKQ0lUe2lfbDB2M19jdGYkX3QwMH0=`
You get something interesting.
## Flag

After decryption you get:
```
Wow, what a beautiful little poem. I almost shed a tear reading that. Hopefully you learned more about email headers. But seriously, it gets me wondering... do you love CTFs as much as they do?
CIT{i_l0v3_ctf$_t00}
```
Which includes at the end the correct flag:
CIT{i_l0v3_ctf$_t00}
