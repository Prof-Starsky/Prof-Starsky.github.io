## Solution

By putting the chicked_jockey image into Aperisolve you're able to use its Zsteg function to find the hidden text VEhJU19pc19hX2NyYWZ0aW5nX3RhYmxl which looks exactly like base64 encrypted text.-

## Flag

And after decrypting VEhJU19pc19hX2NyYWZ0aW5nX3RhYmxl through base64 and wrapping it with CIT{} you get the correct flag:
CIT{THIS_is_a_crafting_table}
