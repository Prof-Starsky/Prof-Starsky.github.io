Welcome to CTF@CIT!
Welcome
Worth 10 Points
```

Welcome to the second annual CTF@CIT!

Please remember to familarize yourself with the [rules](https://ctf.cyber-cit.club/rules), check out our [sponsors](https://ctf.cyber-cit.club/rules), but most importantly remember to have fun and learn something new this weekend!

The flag format for all challenges will be `CIT{}` unless noted otherwise

We are using **dynamic scoring** to automatically balance the point reward for every challenge. Each challenge will start with 1,000 points and will go down every solve. This point reduction will reduce points for everyone who has already solved the challenge too, so don’t worry if you see your points go down. This was used so the amount of solves on the challenge would determine how many points it’s worth instead of us arbitrarily choosing numbers. By the end of the competition, every challenge should be worth a fair amount of points depending on how difficult it is.

**Flag:** `CIT{welcome2025}`

## Solution

After looking through the challenge description very carefully, I noticed some odd text with separate meaning from the rest of the description 'Flag:'

## Flag

And after looking next to 'Flag' you find the correct flag:
CIT{welcome2025}
