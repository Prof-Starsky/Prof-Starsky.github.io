Hidden in the bits below, an image wait's to be shown.

And it has a link to download this photo:

## Solution

Based on the challenge description, I knew there had to be some sort of hidden data in the photo to do with Exposure, so I plugged the photo into https://www.aperisolve.com/  and was able to get a superimposed version of the photo:
